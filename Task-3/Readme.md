# Temperature Converter

The user will input a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and press a "convert" button. The converted temperature will then be displayed with the correct unit.
Your UI should include four main elements:

-- Input field for the user to type in their temperature - don't forget to validate that the input is a number!
-- Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or Fahrenheit
-- "Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion
-- Display area for the final converted temperature and unit

## For an extra challenge: I have added in a third conversion option to convert from and to Kelvin as well.
